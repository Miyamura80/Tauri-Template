# Prek Skill

This skill provides instructions for using `prek` in the Tauri-Template project. `prek` replaces `pre-commit` for managing Git hooks and running checks.

## Commands

- `prek run`: Run hooks on changed files.
- `prek run --all-files`: Run hooks on all files in the repository.
- `prek install`: Install Git hooks to run automatically on commit.
- `prek uninstall`: Remove Git hooks.

## Configuration

The configuration is located in `prek.toml`.

## Workflow

1.  **Before Committing**: Run `prek run` to check your changes.
2.  **CI**: The CI pipeline will run checks. Ensure `prek run --all-files` passes locally.
