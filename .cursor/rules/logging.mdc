## Logging Configuration

This project uses a centralized logging configuration with Rust's **tracing** crate. Always use the standardized logging format by initializing the logging system in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`.

```rust
use tracing::{info, warn, error, debug};

// Initialized once in lib.rs run()
// logging::init_logging();

// Then use macros as needed
info!("Info message");
error!("Error message");
debug!("Debug message");
```

The standardized format is configured in `src-tauri/src/logging.rs` and respects settings in `src-tauri/global_config.yaml`.

Never configure logging directly in your files. Always use the centralized configuration to maintain consistent logging format across the entire application.

If for whatever reason some log is not showing up, check the `src-tauri/global_config.yaml` file to see if the log level is enabled.

```yaml
logging:
  levels:
    debug: false
    info: true
    warning: true
    error: true
    critical: true
```
