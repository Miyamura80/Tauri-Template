---

Welcome to the docs! Follow these steps to bootstrap the Tauri + React starter.

## Quick Start

import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

<Steps>
<Step>

### Install Dependencies

Install Bun packages for both workspaces:

```bash
bun install
cd docs && bun install # run in the docs workspace when you update the site
```

The root `bun.lock` (and `docs/bun.lock`) become the single source of truth.

</Step>

<Step>

### Configure Settings

Edit `src-tauri/global_config.yaml` and override values with `APP__...` environment variables via `bun run tauri dev` or Bun scripts.

You can also expose sanitized configuration on the frontend via the built-in `get_app_config` command and `useConfig()` hook.

</Step>

<Step>

### Run the Application

Run the frontend dev server in isolation or launch Tauri end-to-end.

```bash
bun run dev          # frontend-only (React + Vite)
bun run tauri dev     # native app powered by Tauri + Rust
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Run Tests

Keep the repo healthy with linting and tests:

```bash
bun run check        # frontend/TS lint & formatting via Biome
cd docs && bun run lint:links
cd src-tauri && cargo test
bun run knip         # dependency linting
```

</Step>
</Steps>
