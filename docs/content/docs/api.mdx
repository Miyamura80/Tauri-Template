## Overview

This template does not ship with a public API by default. Use this page as a
starting point for documenting any endpoints you add.

## Base URL

Set this once your service is deployed, for example:

```
https://api.example.com
```

## Authentication

Describe required headers or tokens here (for example, bearer tokens or API
keys).

## Error Format

Document the error envelope your API returns. Example shape:

```
{
  "error": "string",
  "message": "string"
}
```

## Endpoints

Add your endpoints here as they are implemented.
